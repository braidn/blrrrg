<h3>Top 6</h3>
<p>
  For folks who are are absolutely new here or perhaps
  have only showed up once, this is a curated list
  to get to know me, my writing style and what to expect
  from this space.
</p>
<p>
  These posts will help anyone assertain not only the tone
  that I aim for but, the content and depth that you can
  expect from anything new that may appear in your RSS
  reader or inbox of choice.
</p>
<p>
  This list is also very transitional and <em>highly</em>
  likely to change. If it's the only thing you read here,
  make sure to come back by for a new list bimonthly
</p>

{% for post in posts reversed %}
