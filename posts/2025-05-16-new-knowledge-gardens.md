Over the past 6 (ish) years, a plethora of note taking tools or 'startups' have launched.
Many of them following on the much contested heals of [Roam Research][rmr].
These other companies (much like Roam), ended up taking some form of capital investment
and then promptly [shipping nothing][shp].

This cumulates into a world of languishing knowledge management applications in 2025.
